<p>
  Given a matrix with a dimension of N x N, rotate the matrix 90 degrees to the right.
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
[
  [0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 1]
]
</code></pre>

<p>
  For example, the matrix above should be transformed into a matrix like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
[
  [0, 1, 0, 0], 
  [1, 1, 1, 1], 
  [1, 0, 0, 0], 
  [1, 0, 1, 0]
]
</code></pre>

<h2>Coding Challenge</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Implement one method called <code>rotate</code> that rotates the matrix using another array</li>
  <li>Implement another method called <code>rotate_in_place</code> that rotates the matrix <strong>in-place</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>In-place means to rotate the matrix without creating a new array to hold the rotated matrix</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Make sure all tests pass</li>
</ol>

<h2>Hints</h2>

<p>
  To get started, take a piece of paper and a pen and solve it by hand. Once you have solved it by hand, observe step by step how you actually managed to solve it. Take that logic and transfer it into code.
