<h1>Overview of the languages and tools you will be using</h1>

<p>
  Through out your time with Techrise, you'll be learning a bunch of stuff. The main languages and frameworks you will be learning will be Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Git/GitHub.
</p>

<p>
	So what in the world does that mean and what does each language or tool do? Because we don't want to confuse you, we're going to keep everything <strong>SUPER</strong> simple. All you need to know at this point is the general gist of each term.
</p>

<h2>Ruby</h2>
<p>
	As we covered in the last lesson, Ruby is a super beginner friendly programming language (doesn't mean that it's a "beginner's language", a lot of advanced programmers use it). 
</p>

<h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>
<p>
	Ruby on Rails is a web framework that allows you to build dynamic apps using both front end and back end development. It uses Ruby as the language. In case you were wondering, yes, web frameworks are indeed different from programming languages. Web frameworks allows you to build full web applications easily using programming languages, while programming languages are just languages that simply communicate with the computer.
</p>

<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>
  HTML is a language that describes the structure of the web page. Every web page has an HTML file and it's what dictates what you see on the browser.
</p>

<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
  CSS is a style sheet language that describes how the web page should be displayed. So basically with CSS, you can make the web page have a super pink background, make the fonts huge, or anything you wish it to look like.
</p>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>
  Basically, JavaScript is a language that can interact with HTML to make your websites interactive. Interacting with the HTML means we can change the text on the page, the background color on the page, make things move around in pretty ways, and so many more different things with scripts using JavaScript. Beware - Java and JavaScript are two completelydifferent languages!
</p>

<h2>jQuery</h2>
<p>
  jQuery is a JavaScript library - it's a collection of useful scripts written by other smart people that you can use to make your life easier. JavaScript and jQuery use the same language, but jQuery uses a little different syntax. It's a little more complicated than that, but in general just remember jQuery is a tool that does the same things that JavaScript can do, but much easier.
</p>

<h2>Git/GitHub</h2>
<p>
  Git allows a team to work together without much confusion. Imagine you have to write some kind of essay with 20 different people. How would you effectively know which person is writing which part and editing which part? Wouldn't it be easier if there was a tool that allowed the team to see where changes were made, who made those changes, and also kept the previous changes that you can always revert back to? That's what Git enables you to do.
</p>

<p>
  If you want a more in-depth view of what each of these tools are, you'll find a bunch of resources online about these topics. We've given you just the super high-level descriptions of these terms, but it's enough to get you started. Make sure you really understand these simple descriptions using the quizzes below though!
