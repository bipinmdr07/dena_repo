<p>
  Now that users can post reviews about movies, let's display them onto a page along with the movie information.
</p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Display all movie information</li>
  <li>Display all reviews for the movie</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If there are no reviews yet, display "No one has reviewed this movie yet"</li>
  </ul>
  <li>If the user has not reviewed the movie yet, display a form for posting a new review</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hints</h2>

<p>
  To check if the current user has reviewed the movie already, create a model method called <code>reviewed?</code> that takes in a parameter called <code>movie</code>, that checks if the user has reviewed the movie, and returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. We can then call the model method like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
current_user.reviewed?(@movie)
</code></pre>
