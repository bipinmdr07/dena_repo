  Our application right now is pretty cool - users can search the title of a movie and get the details of the movie instantly. However, there's not much more to it at the current state.
</p>

<p>
  Let's build a feature so that users can post reviews to the movies they've watched.
</p>

<h2>Our Strategy</h2>

<p>
  In order to save the reviews the users post and tie them with a movie, we need to store the movie in the database as well. Here's what we are going to do:
</p>  

<ul>
  <li>User posts a review for a movie</li>
  <li>If the movie for the review exists in the database, connect the review with that movie</li>
  <li>Otherwise, create a new movie and save connect it with the review</li> 
</ul>

<p>
  Our first step is to create a <code>Movie</code> model and a <code>movies</code> database table so we can store our movies into our database.
</p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Generate a <code>Movie</code> model</li>
  <li>Include the following columns in the database migration:</li>

<pre><code class="ruby">
create_table :movies do |t|
  t.string :title
  t.string :year
  t.string :rated
  t.string :released
  t.string :runtime
  t.string :genre
  t.string :director
  t.string :writer
  t.string :actors
  t.string :plot
  t.string :language
  t.string :country
  t.string :awards
  t.string :poster
  t.string :metascore
  t.string :imdbrating
  t.string :imdbvotes
  t.string :imdbid
  t.timestamps
end
</code></pre>

  <li>Add an index to the <code>imdbid</code> column since we are going to be querying movies using this a lot</li>

  <li>Validate the presence of each of these columns</li>
</ul>
