<h1><%= title_for(IdeatorLesson, 3, 3) %></h1>

<p>
	Now that we’ve got a navbar, let’s go ahead and make it sexy.
</p>

<p>
	First, if you haven’t done so, let’s change the Brand name in the navbar. To do this, let's replace the “Brand” text in the navbar with “Ideator”.
</p>

<pre><code class="erb">
&lt;div class="navbar-header"&gt;
  &lt;button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#bs-example-navbar-collapse-1" aria-expanded="false"&gt;
    &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Toggle navigation&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon-bar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon-bar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon-bar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;a class="navbar-brand" href="/"&gt;Ideator&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
	Now that we have our new brand name in there, let's make it look nicer. We can do this by changing the font. In order to make this font sexy, we’re going to be using a custom font.
</p>

<p>
	There are many websites that allow you to install fonts to your website. One of the easiest ways to implement a font is to use <strong>Google Fonts</strong>. So let’s go ahead and do that.
</p>

<p>
	If we go to <a href = "https://www.google.com/fonts" target = "_blank">Google Fonts</a>, we can see that there are a bunch of fonts that we can use. I like the font “Pacifico” so I’m going to go ahead and search for “Pacifico” in the search bar.
</p>

<p>
	Once we do that, we should be taken to a screen that looks like the image below. Click on the button with the arrow in the bottom right hand corner.
</p>

<%= image_tag 'googlefonts.png', class: 'screenshot' %>

<p>
	If we scroll down to <strong>“3. Add this code to your website:”</strong>, you can see that it gives us ways to import the font into the website.
</p>

<%= image_tag 'googlefonts2.png', class: "screenshot" %>
<p>
	We’re just going to copy and paste the code that they have here and put it in our <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section in <code>application.html.erb</code>.
</p>

<p>
	So let’s go ahead and go into sublime and open up <code>application.html.erb</code>. In your &lt;head&gt; section, add in the code. It should look something like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="erb">
&lt;link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Pacifico' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
	Great! Just like that, the font can be used in our application.
</p>

<p>
	To use this font for the brand name in the navbar, we need to specify the font using CSS. If we go back to the bootstrap navbar we implemented and look at which CSS class the brand text belongs to, we notice that it belongs to a <code>navbar-brand</code> class. This means that we can apply CSS styling to <code>.navbar-brand</code> to apply our new font.
</p>

<p>
  Let's create a new <code>SCSS</code> file to store our styling. In sublime, create a new file in <code>app/assets/stylesheets</code> called <code>master.scss</code>. We will put all of our CSS styling in this folder.
</p>

<div class="well">
  <h3>What is SCSS?</h3>

  <p>
    SCSS files are CSS files that with super powers. SCSS stands for <strong>Sassy CSS</strong>. Rails uses SCSS by default. You can use the normal CSS syntax in these SCSS files as you would with CSS files.
  </p>

  <p>
    We won't get into how you can use SCSS here (we'll do that in another lesson), but if you want to learn about SCSS, here are a few resources to get you started:
  </p>  

  <ul>
    <li><%= link_to 'http://sass-lang.com/guide' %></li>
    <li><%= link_to 'https://css-tricks.com/sass-style-guide/' %></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
	In <code>master.scss</code>, let’s apply the font to our brand by adding this line:
</p>

<pre><code class = "css">
.navbar-brand {
  font-family: 'Pacifico'
}
</code></pre>
 
<p>
	Let’s go back into our browser and refresh our <code>localhost:3000</code>. Awesome! It looks great.
</p>

<p>
	Now that we’ve got our brand name looking pretty awesome, I want to change the color of the navbar itself. If we go into Google Chrome and right click on the navbar and select inspect, it will open up Google Developer Tools.
</p>

<p>
	Try to find the section where the navbar’s color is being determined.
</p>


<!-- Add video here -->

<p>
	If you found correctly, the <code>.navbar-default</code> class is responsible for the color of the navbar. Since I want a clean looking site, I’m going to change the background color of <code>.navbar-default</code> to white.
</p>

<p>Let’s go into our <code>master.scss</code> and add this in.</p>

<pre><code class = "css">
.navbar-default {
  background-color: white;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
	Cool, now we’ve got a nice simple color. The other thing I want to do now is change how the font is styled in the navbar.
</p>

<p>
	We can play around with the font styles by adding something like this to our <code>master.scss</code>
</p>

<pre><code class = "css">
.navbar-default .navbar-brand {
  font-weight: 100;
  letter-spacing: 8px;
  font-size: 30px;
}
</code></pre>

<div class="well">
  <h3>Font Styles</h3>

  <p>
    There are a number of different ways to style fonts. By applying different styles to fonts, you can drastically change the look and style of your website! Here are some of my favorites:
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>font-weight</code>: This changes the "weight" of your font, or how skinny or fat your font is. It ranges from <code>100</code> (skinniest) to <code>600</code> (bold). Keep in mind that some fonts only have a few variations of font-weights so you won't be able to change the font-weights for those.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>letter-spacing</code>: This changes the amount of space between each letter. For example <span style="letter-spacing:3px;">a letter-spacing of 3px is applied to this text</span> and <span style="letter-spacing:10px;">a letter-spacing of 10px is applied to this text</span>. Pretty cool stuff :)
  </p>

  <p>
    There a bunch more that you could use, but personally I like to play around with these two properties to achieve different styles.
  </p>

</div>

<p>
  Let’s now commit this to GitHub so we don’t lose any of the changes. From now on, we'll call this the <strong>standard git workflow</strong>.
</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
git add .
git commit -am “Style navbar”
git push origin master
</code></pre>



<script>
$( '#HideHighFive' ).click(function() {
	$( '#HideHighFive' ).hide();
	$( " #HighFive " ).show();
  $( " #HighFive " ).hide( "puff", {percent:500}, 2000 );
  $( '#HideHighFive' ).delay(2000).show(0);
});
</script>
