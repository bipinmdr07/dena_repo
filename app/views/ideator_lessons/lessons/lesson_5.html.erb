<p>
	Now that we’ve got our first page running, let’s install bootstrap so that we can make our page look awesome.
</p>

<p>
	This time with rails, instead of using the CDN to use bootstrap, we are going to use a gem. Gems are basically super useful packages of code that solve common problems, for instance installing bootstrap in this case. There are gems for everything - forms, user log in/authentication, messagers, etc. Smart people have created these solutions for us already so it’s stupid to reinvent the wheel most of the time.
</p>

<p>So let’s go ahead and install our first gem.</p>

<p>In sublime, let’s open up gemfile. You’ll see a bunch of gems inside this file.</p>

<p>
	Let’s add the bootstrap-sass gem here. The documentation can be found here https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass. Typically, the instructions on how to install and use these gems are written inside.
</p>

<p>So like the documentation tells us, inside our gemfile let’s add</p>
<code>gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.3.6'</code>

<p>Next, inside our console let’s run</p>
<code>bundle install</code>

<p>
	This will install the gems for us. Everytime we run bundle install, we have to restart the server. Let’s go back into the console where the server is running and restart it.
</p>

<p>To do this, hit Command + C. To restart the server, hit the up arrow and press enter, or type in rails server again.</p>

<p>Awesome. Next, it tells us to copy and paste some code. It’s telling us to rename application.css to application.scss. We could manually rename it, but the documentation also gives us a command that we can run in the console that does just this.</p>

<code>mv app/assets/stylesheets/application.css app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss</code>

<p>Let’s run that command to rename the file.</p>

<p>Now inside application.scss, let’s copy and paste the follow code like this:</p>


<code>@import "bootstrap-sprockets";</code><br>
<code>@import "bootstrap";</code>
<gist>

<p>The documentation tells us to  remove all the *= require_self and *= require_tree . statements from the sass file but let’s not worry about this and ignore it.</p>

<p>Next it tells us to copy and paste this into application.js</p>

<code>//= require jquery</code><br>
<code>//= require bootstrap-sprockets</code>

<p>Awesome. You should now be set.</p>

<p>Refresh <code>localhost:3000</code> and your font should have changed into a different font. That means your bootstrap has been installed! Great job!</p>

<p>
	Let’s now commit this to GitHub so we don’t lose any of the changes.
</p>

<code>git add .</code><br>
<code>git commit -am “Add bootstrap”</code><br>
<code>git push origin master</code>
