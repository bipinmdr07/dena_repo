<p>
	Get ready to embark on a new journey in your web development career! From this lesson, we'll be creating rails applications together, where you'll learn how to create full featured applications.
</p>

<p>
	Let's get started!
</p>

<p>
	<strong>First, download Tokaido <a href = "https://github.com/tokaido/tokaidoapp/releases" target = "_blank">Here</a>.</strong> This will enable you to use Ruby on Rails instantly.
</p>
<!-- <p>
	Download Postgre <a href = "http://postgresapp.com/" target = "_blank">Here</a>
</p> -->

<p>
	<strong>Let's open Tokaido and click Open Terminal.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	In the terminal, let’s navigate to our desktop by running the following command.
</p>


<pre><code class="bash">
cd ~/desktop
</code></pre>

<p>
	This is where we’ll create our ideator app. In the terminal that we just opened up, let’s type in the following command.
</p>


<pre><code class="bash">
rails new ideator
</code></pre>

<p>
	This command magically creates a new rails application. Awesome!
</p>

<p>
	It should create a bunch of files and you shouldn’t get any errors. If you do, make sure that everything is spelled out correctly.
</p>


<p>
	Great, now that we’ve created our new rails app, let’s start this baby up. Let’s go into Tokaido and <strong>open up another terminal window</strong>.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">
	We want to have two terminal windows open since we want <strong>one for running the server and one for typing in rails commands</strong>. You'll notice that the terminal window that is running the server (the terminal window where you typed in rails server) will not respond to anything that you type in. <strong>You can only execute commands in terminal windows that doesn't have a server running on it.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	In one of the terminal windows, let’s navigate to our project folder.
</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
cd ~/desktop/ideator
</code></pre>

<p>
	First we have to create our initial database. In the terminal enter
</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
rake db:create:all
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="bash">
rake db:migrate
</code></pre>

<div class="well">
	<h3>No Rakefile found?</h3>
	<p>
		If you get an error saying <code>No Rakefile found</code>, chances are you didn't navigate to your <code>ideator</code> folder before running the <code>rake</code> commands.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you haven't done so, make sure to enter <code>cd ~/desktop/ideator</code> before entering the <code>rake</code> commands.
	</p>

	<p>	
		If that doesn't work, make sure you are running the terminal from Tokaido. If you haven't done so, <strong>open Tokaido and click "Open Terminal"</strong>.
	</p>

</div>

<p>
	Now let’s fire up our rails server by entering this command.
</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
rails server
</code></pre>

<p>
	Give it a few seconds to load. Now go into your browser and go to
</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
http://localhost:3000/
</code></pre>

<p>
	You should see a nice welcome page from Ruby on Rails.
</p>

<div class="well">
	<h3>Don't see a nice welcome page?</h3>
	<p>
		If the <code>rails server</code> command is giving you errors, chances are you didn't navigate to your <code>ideator</code> folder.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you haven't done so, make sure to enter <code>cd ~/desktop/ideator</code> before entering <code>rails server</code>.
	</p>

	<p>	
		If that doesn't work, make sure you are running the terminal from Tokaido. If you haven't done so, <strong>open Tokaido and click "Open Terminal"</strong>.
	</p>

</div>

<p>
  Awesome! You're one step closer to finishing your first rails app!
