<p>
	Let's go back to the <code>Cat</code> class that we wrote.
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
class Cat
	attr_accessor :name, :age

	def initialize(name, age)
		@name = name
		@age = age
	end	
end
</code></pre>

<p>
	As we discussed before, cats can do these things:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Walk forward</li>
	<li>Run</li>
	<li>Jump</li>
	<li>Eat</li>
</ul>	

<p>
	And as we talked about before, the things that objects can <strong><em>do</em></strong> are methods in object oriented programming. What we are going to do is create <strong><em>instance methods</em></strong> for each of these actions.
</p>

<div class="well">
	<h3>Instance Methods</h3>

	<p>
		Instance methods are methods that can only be called on an <strong><em>instance</em></strong> of a class. In other words, the object has to first be created in order to execute the method:
	</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
class Cat
	def initialize(name)
		@name = name
	end

	def meow
		puts "Meow"
	end
end

cat = Cat.new("Cathy")

# This works
cat.meow

# This will give us an error, since we are not calling it on an instance of a class
Cat.meow
=> NoMethodError: undefined method `meow' for Cat:Class
</code></pre>

</div>

<p>
	Let's create <strong>instance methods</strong> for these four actions in our <code>Cat</code> class. Edit your <code>Cat</code> class to look like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
class Cat
	attr_accessor :name, :age

	def initialize(name, age)
		@name = name
		@age = age
	end	

	def walk_forward
		puts "Meow! I'm walking forward!"
	end

	def run
		puts "Meow! I'm running!"
	end

	def jump
		puts "Meow! I'm jumping!"
	end

	def eat
		puts "Meow! This stuff is yummy."
	end
end

cat = Cat.new("Beth", 6)

cat.walk_forward
cat.run
cat.jump
cat.eat
</code></pre>

<p>
	Save the file and run the program:
</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
ruby cat.rb
</code></pre>

<p>
	You can see that the instance methods executed correctly. Let's also add another method called <code>say_introduction</code> that prints out the cat's name and age. Change your <code>Cat</code> class to look like below:
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
class Cat
	attr_accessor :name, :age

	def initialize(name, age)
		@name = name
		@age = age
	end	

	def walk_forward
		puts "Meow! I'm walking forward!"
	end

	def run
		puts "Meow! I'm running!"
	end

	def jump
		puts "Meow! I'm jumping!"
	end

	def eat
		puts "Meow! This stuff is yummy."
	end

	def say_introduction
		puts "Meow! My name is #{@name} and I'm #{@age}!"
	end
end

cat = Cat.new("Beth", 6)

cat.walk_forward
cat.run
cat.jump
cat.eat

cat.say_introduction
</code></pre>

<p>
	If the program ran correctly, you should see the following output:
</p>	

<pre><code class="bash">
Meow! I'm walking forward!
Meow! I'm running!
Meow! I'm jumping!
Meow! This stuff is yummy!
Meow! My name is Beth and I'm 6!
</code></pre>

<p>
	As you can see, <strong>you can use instance variables inside instance methods</strong>. In the example above, we are calling <code>@name</code> and <code>@age</code> inside <code>say_introduction</code>.
</p>

<h3>Class Methods and Class Variables</h3>		

<p>
	Let's say we want to count the number of <code>Cat</code> objects we have. In this case, we will use <strong>class methods</strong> and <strong>class variables</strong>.
</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Class Methods</strong> - methods that are declared with <code>self.method_name</code>. Class methods work for the class, and not for instances of classes.</li>
	<li><strong>Class Variables</strong> - variables prefixed with <code>@@</code>. Class variables can be used by the entire class, but aren't specific to the instance of the class.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>It differs from instance variables because instance variables are values stored within <em>specific instances</em> of the class.</li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<p>
	Let's take a look at an example. In our <code>Cat</code> class, let's add a <strong>class variable</strong> called <code>@@count</code>. This variable will hold the number of <code>Cat</code> objects that exist. We will also increment <code>@@count</code> by 1 in the <code>initialize</code> method, so that every time a <code>Cat</code> object is created, the <code>@@count</code> is updated.
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
class Cat
	attr_accessor :name, :age
	@@count = 0

	def initialize(name, age)
		@name = name
		@age = age
		@@count += 1
	end	

	def walk_forward
		puts "Meow! I'm walking forward!"
	end

	def run
		puts "Meow! I'm running!"
	end

	def jump
		puts "Meow! I'm jumping!"
	end

	def eat
		puts "Meow! This stuff is yummy."
	end

	def say_introduction
		puts "Meow! My name is #{@name} and I'm #{@age}!"
	end
end
</code></pre>

<p>
	Next, let's add a <strong>class method</strong> called <code>count</code>. This method will output the number of <code>Cat</code> objects that exist.
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
class Cat
	attr_accessor :name, :age
	@@count = 0

	def initialize(name, age)
		@name = name
		@age = age
		@@count += 1
	end	

	def walk_forward
		puts "Meow! I'm walking forward!"
	end

	def run
		puts "Meow! I'm running!"
	end

	def jump
		puts "Meow! I'm jumping!"
	end

	def eat
		puts "Meow! This stuff is yummy."
	end

	def say_introduction
		puts "Meow! My name is #{@name} and I'm #{@age}!"
	end

	def self.count
		puts "Number of cats: #{@@count}"
	end
end
</code></pre>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Let's now call the <code>count</code> method. <strong>When we call a class method, we have to call it on the class, and not on an instance of a class.</strong> 
</p>

<p>
	For example this works:
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
Cat.count
=> Number of cats: 1
</code></pre>

<p>The example below <strong>won't</strong> work, since class methods don't work on instances:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
cathy = Cat.new("Cathy", 6)

cathy.count
=> undefined method `count' for #&lt;Cat:0x0000000138c330 @name="Cathy" @age=6&gt; (NoMethodError)
</code></pre>

<p>
	In our <code>cat.rb</code> file, let's create two cats and see if the count is correctly updated. Update your file to look like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
class Cat
	attr_accessor :name, :age
	@@count = 0

	def initialize(name, age)
		@name = name
		@age = age
		@@count += 1
	end	

	def walk_forward
		puts "Meow! I'm walking forward!"
	end

	def run
		puts "Meow! I'm running!"
	end

	def jump
		puts "Meow! I'm jumping!"
	end

	def eat
		puts "Meow! This stuff is yummy."
	end

	def say_introduction
		puts "Meow! My name is #{@name} and I'm #{@age}!"
	end

	def self.count
		puts "Number of cats: #{@@count}"
	end
end

cathy = Cat.new("Cathy", 6)
beth = Cat.new("Beth", 5)

Cat.count
</code></pre>

<p>
	If you coded it correctly, you see this output:
</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
Number of cats: 2
</code></pre>


<hr>

<p>
	Let's add a new instance method called <code>say_human_age</code> that will output the cat's age in human years! 
</p>

<p>
	This is the algorithm to convert a cat's age to human years (probably not 100% accurate):
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Allow 15 human years for the first year of your cat's life.</li>
	<li>Add nine years for the second year. A two-year old cat will approximate 24 human years.</li>
	<li>Add four human years each for successive years of his life.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Let's put this into code and print out the human age in our <code>say_human_age</code> method:
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
def say_human_age
  human_years
  if @age == 1
    human_years = 15
  elsif @age == 2
	  # add 15 + 9
	  human_years = 24
  else
    # add the first 2 years plus the age subtracted by the first two years, multiplied by 4
    human_years = 24 + (@age - 2) * 4
  end
  
  puts "I'm #{human_years} in human years!"
end
</code></pre>

<p>
	Let's now add this to our <code>Cat</code> class, if you haven't done so already. Make your <code>Cat</code> class look like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
class Cat
	attr_accessor :name, :age
	@@count = 0

	def initialize(name, age)
		@name = name
		@age = age
		@@count += 1
	end	

	def walk_forward
		puts "Meow! I'm walking forward!"
	end

	def run
		puts "Meow! I'm running!"
	end

	def jump
		puts "Meow! I'm jumping!"
	end

	def eat
		puts "Meow! This stuff is yummy."
	end

	def say_introduction
		puts "Meow! My name is #{@name} and I'm #{@age}!"
	end

	def self.count
		puts "Number of cats: #{@@count}"
	end

	def say_human_age
	  human_years
	  if @age == 1
	    human_years = 15
	  elsif @age == 2
		  # add 15 + 9
		  human_years = 24
	  else
	    # add the first 2 years plus the age subtracted by the first two years, multiplied by 4
	    human_years = 24 + (@age - 2) * 4
	  end
	  
	  puts "I'm #{human_years} in human years!"
	end
end
</code></pre>

<p>
	Let's now create a couple of <code>Cat</code> objects with different ages and test if the <code>say_human_age</code> is working. Add the following lines of code to the end of the <code>cat.rb</code> file:
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
cat_1 = Cat.new("Beth", 1)
cat_2 = Cat.new("Beth", 2)
cat_3 = Cat.new("Beth", 6)

cat_1.say_human_years
cat_2.say_human_years
cat_3.say_human_years
</code></pre>

<p>
	Save the file and run the program. The results should be this:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>1 Year Old Cat = 15 years old in human years</li>
	<li>2 Year Old Cat = 24 years old in human years</li>
	<li>6 Year Old Cat = 40 years old in human years</li>
</ol>

<p>
	This is pretty awesome, but we can write our code in better ways. Let's <strong>refactor</strong> our code. Refactoring means to rewrite our code to improve the quality of the code, to make it more cleaner, more understandable, maintainable, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Right now inside the <code>say_human_age</code> method, we are doing two things:
</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Calculating</strong> the cat's age in human years</li>
	<li><strong>Outputting</strong> the cat's age in human years</li>
</ol>

<p>
	<strong>In general, methods should be responsible for doing only one thing.</strong> This is often called the <strong>Single Responsibility Principle</strong>. When you introduce too many responsibilities for a method or a class, it often leads to unmaintainable code. You don't need to worry too much about this just yet, but just keep in mind that in general, <strong>a method should only do one single thing</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	Since our <code>say_human_age</code> method should only be responsible for outputting the cat's age in human years, let's move the calculation part to another method.
</p>

<p>
	Let's add a new method called <code>calculate_human_age</code>, and move the calculation in that method. Change your code to look like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
def say_human_age
  puts "I'm #{calculate_human_age} in human years!"
end

def calculate_human_age
  if @age == 1
    return 15
  elsif @age == 2
    return 24
  else
    return 24 + (@age - 2) * 4
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>
	As you can see, now we have two methods that are each responsible for only one thing.
</p>	

<hr>

<h3>self</h3>

<p>
	<code>self</code> is a concept in Ruby that is quite hard to grasp at first.
</p>

<p>
  Simply put, <code>self</code> refers to the current object:
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
class WhatIsSelf
  def test
    puts "At the instance level, self is #{self}"
  end

  def self.test
    puts "At the class level, self is #{self}"
  end
end

WhatIsSelf.test 
 #=&gt; At the class level, self is WhatIsSelf

WhatIsSelf.new.test 
 #=&gt; At the instance level, self is #&lt;WhatIsSelf:0x28190&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
	<strong>The example above indicates two things</strong>:
</p>	

<ol>
	<li>at the class level, <code>self</code> is the class, in this case <code>WhatIsSelf</code>.</li>
	<li>at the instance level, <code>self</code> is the instance in context, in this case the instance of <code>WhatIsSelf</code> at memory location <code>0x28190</code>.</li>
</ol>


<hr >

<h3>Private Methods and Encapsulation</h3>

<p>
	Private methods are methods that cannot be called from outside of the class. Everything below <code>private</code> will be a private method:
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
class Test
	def initialize
	end

	def test_public
		# Private methods can be called within the class
		test_private
	end

	private
	# everything below here is private

	def test_private
		puts "This is private"
	end
end	

test = Test.new

# This will work
test.test_public

# This will not work
test.test_private
</code></pre>
	
<p>
	<strong>Private methods are useful because they can hide some methods that should be hidden from the outside world.</strong> For example, in our <code>Cat</code> class, the outside world simply only needs to know that there is a method to output the cat's age in human years. It shouldn't need to know about <em>how</em> we are actually calculating it.
</p>

<p>
	This is broadly a computer science concept called <strong>encapsulation</strong>. The basic idea is that by hiding <em>how</em> we are doing things, or in other words by hiding the implementation of the code, we allow whoever is using the method to just implement it without caring about how it's actually implemented.
</p>

<p>
	It's similar to a restaurant kitchens. Customers order food off of a menu. The orders then come to the customer without the customer interfering with how the food is made in the kitchen. The menu is exposed to the customer, but what happens inside the kitchen is completely private.
</p>

<h3>Public Interfaces and Private Interfaces</h3>

<p>
	Continuing with the example of a restaurant kitchen, there are things the customer should know about, and there are things that should be hidden from the customer. 
</p>

<p>
	In object oriented programming, the things that the outside world should know about are called <strong>public interfaces</strong> and the things that should be hidden from the outside world are called <strong>private interfaces</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Public Interface</li>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>The food menu</strong> - customers order food off of this menu.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Private Interface</li>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>What happens inside the kitchen</strong> - the customer is not welcome to stir the soup inside the kitchen</li>
	</ul>
</ul>	

<p>
	By seperating the kitchen (or the code) in public and private interfaces, it lets the user ask for <strong><em>what</em></strong> they want without knowing anything about <strong><em>how</em></strong> the kitchen makes it.
</p>	

<p>
	In programming, <strong>public methods inside a class make up the public interface, and the private methods inside a class make up the private interface.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Let's take a look at a simple program that calculates a "Lucky Number" based on the name:
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
class LuckyNumberGenerator
  def initialize(name)
  	@name = name
  end

  def display_lucky_number
  	number = calculate_lucky_number
  	puts "My lucky number is #{number}!"
  end

  private

  def calculate_lucky_number
  	(@name.length * 15 / 0.3 + 5).round
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>
	In this case, the public interface consists of the <code>display_lucky_number</code> method, and then private interface consists of the <code>calculate_lucky_number</code> method.
</p>

<p>
	In this case, the <code>calculate_lucky_number</code> method is made private, since the implementation details shouldn't be exposed to the user. Instead, it should be kept hidden, just like a kitchen doesn't expose what exactly is happening in the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
	Another thing to note is that <strong>how the lucky number is calculated might change in the future</strong>. <strong>the public interface should only consist of methods that are unlikely to change</strong>. <strong>The private interface can consist of methods are allowed to change</strong>, like the <code>calculate_lucky_number</code> method.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Instance methods are methods that can only be called on an <em>instance</em> of a class</li>
	<li>Class methods are methods that can be called on the class itself</li> 
	<li>Class methods are declared with <code>def self.method_name</code></li>
	<li>Variables prefixed with <CODE>@@</CODE> are <strong><em>class variables</em></strong></li>
	<li>Class variables are variables that can be used by the entire class</li>
	<li><code>self</code> refers to the current object in context</li>
	<li>Private methods allow developers to hide the implementation of methods (encapsulation)</li>

</ul>


<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>
	Let's build a <code>Quote</code> class that represents a single quote with a <code>content</code> and <code>author</code> attribute. 
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>The public interface should consist of:</strong></li>
	<ol>
		<li>Getter and setter methods for <code>content</code> and <code>author</code></li>	
		<li>An <strong><em>instance method</em></strong> called <code>display_quote</code> that prints out <code>#{quote} by #{author}</code></li>
		<li>A <strong><em>class method</em></strong> called <code>random</code> that will print out the <code>content</code> of a random quote</li>
	</ol>
</ul>

<p>
	The program should work like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
Quote.new("Stay hungry, stay foolish", "Steve Jobs")
Quote.new("Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.", "Bill Gates")
Quote.new("By giving people the power to share, we're making the world more transparent.", "Mark Zuckerberg")

Quote.random
=> #&lt;Quote:0x007fa420835d30 @content="Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.", @author="Bill Gates"&gt;

linus_quote = Quote.new("Talk is cheap. Show me the code.", "Linus Torvalds")
linus_quote.display_quote
=> Talk is cheap. Show me the code. by Linus Torvalds
</code></pre>

<p>
	<strong>Hint:</strong> Create a class variable that will hold all of the quotes. Every time a <code>Quote</code> object is instantiated, it should be added to this class variable.
</p>
