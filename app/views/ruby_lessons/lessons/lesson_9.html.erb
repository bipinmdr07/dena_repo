<p>
  <strong>Hashes are objects with that contain a pair of <em>keys</em> and <em>values</em>.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Below is a hash that contain the name of a person and the age.
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
people = {
  "Jake" => 30,
  "Adam" => 31,
  "Mike" => 25
}
</code></pre>

<p>
  As you can see, hashes can be created with the <code>{}</code> syntax.
</p>

<p>
  In the <code>people</code> hash above, <code>"Jake"</code> is the <strong><em>key</em></strong>, and <code>30</code> is the <strong><em>value</em></strong>. <code>"Jake"</code> and <code>30</code> are paired, thus they are called <strong>key value pairs</strong>. 
</p>  

<p>
  Next, <code>"Adam"</code> is the <strong><em>key</em></strong>, and <code>31</code> is the <strong><em>value</em></strong>. Again, <code>"Adam"</code> and <code>31</code> are a <strong>key value pair</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Let's say we want to get the age of <code>"Jake"</code>. We can simply write the following code:
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
people["Jake"]
=> 30
</code></pre>

<p>
  As you can see, <strong>with hashes, we give it the key and we get the value</strong>.
</p>

<p>
 We can also replace the value of a key easily:
</p>  


<pre><code class="irb">
# We give it the key and we get the value
people["Jake"]
=> 30

# We can assign the value of the key to something else
people["Jake"] = 100

# Now the value is 100 (it used to be 30)
people["Jake"]
=> 100
</code></pre>

<p>
  We can also add to a value like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
people["Jake"]
=> 100

people["Jake"] += 5

people["Jake"]
=> 105
</code></pre>

<div class="well">
  <h3>+=, -=, *=, /=</h3>

  <p>
    When programming, you will see <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code>, <code>/</code> being used quite a lot. They are self-explanatory - take a look at the examples below:
  </p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
number = 5

# 5 + 5
number += 5

number
=> 10

# 10 - 2
number -= 2

number
=> 8

# 8 * 5
number *= 5

number
=> 40

# 40 / 10
number /= 10

number
=> 10
</code></pre>

<p>
  We are basically taking the existing value of the variable and performing mathematical operations on them. For example:
</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
number = 5

# This is the same as
number *= 10  

# this
5 * 10
</code></pre>

</div>

<p>
  We can add a new item to our existing hash as such:
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
people["Bob"] = 21

people
=> {"Jake"=>100, "Adam"=>31, "Mike"=>25, "Bob"=>21}
</code></pre>

<p>
  <strong>Hashes are useful when storing data that is a pair.</strong> In the example above, we are storing a name and the age as a pair.
