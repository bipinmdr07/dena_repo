<h1><%= title_for(RubyLesson, 1, 8) %></h1>

<p>
  <strong>Arrays</strong> are objects that hold multiple objects. They are somewhat like lists.
</p>

<p>
  In the interactive ruby console, let's type in the following and press enter:
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]
</code></pre>

<p>
  Now <code>colors</code> holds 3 items, <code>"red"</code>, <code>"blue"</code>, and <code>"green"</code>. 
</p>

<p>
  Arrays can be initialized with the <code>[]</code> syntax. To create an empty array, we simply write code like such:
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
empty_array = []
</code></pre>

<p class="alert alert-success">
  Another way to declare an empty array is with <code>Array.new</code>.
</p>

<h3>Accessing Elements</h3>

<p>
  In the <code>colors</code> array we have created, let's say we want to access the second item, <code>"blue"</code>. In order to do this, we simply enter the following code:
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
colors[1]
=> "blue"
</code></pre>

<p>
  As you can see, you can insert the index of the item next to the variable to retreive the item.
</p>

<div class="well">
  <h3>Zero based indexing</h3>
  <p>
    But wait, <strong>shouldn't it be</strong> <code>colors[2]</code>? Since it's the 2nd item, it would make sense to say <code>colors[2]</code> instead of <code>colors[1]</code>, right?
  </p>  

  <p>
    Well it turns out that in Computer Science, arrays are indexed from 0. That means that the first item would be referenced like <code>colors[0]</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  <strong>We can also replace the element inside of an array</strong>:
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
colors[1]
=> "blue"

colors[1] = "black"
colors
=> ["red", "black", "green"]
</code></pre>

<p>
  Let's make another array. In <code>irb</code>, let's enter the following:
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
people = ["Jack", "Adam", "Mike"]
</code></pre>

<p>
  Here, we have created a <code>people</code> array with the names of 3 people inside of it. Let's go over some common array methods.
</p>

<h2>Array Methods</h2>

<p>
  In Ruby, there are a lot of array methods that we can use. Many of them read like English, so they are fairly easy to understand.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Don't worry about trying to memorize everything</strong> - the goal here is to simply introduce you to some of the methods that Ruby has. You will remember and internalize these methods once you use them a couple of times - but they are impossible to remember at once, so don't worry.
</p>

<p>
  Let's retrieve the first person in the list. To do this, we can simply type the following:
</p>  

<pre><code class="irb">
people.first
=> "Jack"
</code></pre>

<p>
  To retrieve the last person in the list, simply type the following:
</p>  

<pre><code class="irb">
people.last
=> "Mike"
</code></pre>

<p>
  What if we want to find the size of the array? 
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
people.count
=> 3

people.length
=> 3
</code></pre>

<p>
  What if we wanted to see if a person was included in the list?
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
people.include?("Jack")
=> true

people.include?("Bob")
=> false
</code></pre>

<p>
  To get the index of a person:
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
people.index("Jack")
=> 0
</code></pre>

<p>
  To join all of the names into one string:
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
people.join
=> "JackAdamMike"
</code></pre>

<p>
  To join all of the names into one string, but put a space between each name:
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
people.join(" ")
=> "Jack Adam Mike"
</code></pre>

<p>
  To remove the last element from an array:
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
people.pop
=> "Mike"

people
=> ["Jack", "Adam"]
</code></pre>

<p>
  To add an element to the end of the array:
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
people.push("Bob")
=> ["Jack", "Adam", "Bob"]
</code></pre>

<p>
  To reverse the order of an array:
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
people.reverse
=> ["Bob", "Adam", "Jack"]
</code></pre>

<p>
  Get a random element from an array:
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
people.sample
</code></pre>

<p>
  To get only unique elements:
</p>

<pre><code class="irb">
people = ["Jake", "Jake", "Adam", "Mike", "Mike", "Mike"]
people
=> ["Jake", "Jake", "Adam", "Mike", "Mike", "Mike"]

people.uniq
=> ["Jake", "Adam", "Mike"]
</code></pre>

<p>
  There are a bunch of other array methods that would be great to take a look at. You can take a look at them <%= link_to 'here', 'https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html', target: '_blank' %>.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Arrays are objects that hold a list of items</li>
  <li>You can create an empty array with <code>[]</code> or <code>Array.new</code></li>
  <li><strong>Arrays utilize zero based indexing</strong> - the first element's index is <code>0</code></li>
  <li>You can replace elements inside of arrays</li>
  <li>You can access elements by inserting the index like such: <code>people[1]</code> (returns the 2nd element)</li>
  <li>There are many array methods that are easy to use</li>
</ul>
