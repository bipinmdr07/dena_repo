<p>
  Congratulations on finishing your Ruby Fundamentals lessons!
</p>

<p>
  Now that you have a basic grasp on how Ruby works, let's try to apply it in one of the most common basic interview problems: <strong>The Foobar Problem</strong>. This is a real interview problem that is used to weed out applicants who don't have a good grasp on basic programming, so it's really important that you have the necessary skills to solve this problem.
</p>

<h3>The Foobar Problem</h3>

<ul>
  <li>First, prompt the user "How many numbers do you want to see?"</li>
  <li>Next, start from <code>1</code> up to the number that the user inputed</li>
  <li>For each number, do the following:</li>
  <li>For numbers divisble by <code>3</code>, print out <code>Foo</code></li>
  <li>For numbers divisible by <code>5</code>, print out <code>Bar</code></li>
  <li>For numbers divisible by <code>15</code>, print out <code>FooBar</code></li>
  <li>Otherwise, print the number</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is how your problem should look when it is executed:
</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
ruby foobar.rb
How many numbers do you want to see? 3
1
2
Foo
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="bash">
ruby foobar.rb

<%= image_tag 'ruby_lessons/repl_code.png', class: 'img-responsive screenshot', style: 'width: 50%' %>

<p>
  Next, press "run", and check your output.
</p>

<div class="well">
  <h3>HINTS!</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>When you get the user's input, make sure to convert the input into an <code>integer</code>, or else it will give you an error</li>
    <li>Beware of the <strong>order</strong> that you check if the number is divisible by another number</li>
  </ul>
</div>
