                      I am a BSC.CS.IT student. <strong>I love programming, and always thought of becoming a programmer.</strong> But there was a problem whenever I try to learn something new by myself, it was like I was missing something. <strong>When I got stuck there was no one to help me.</strong> I could search it on internet but the problem was I could not get all what I want. After I joined TECHRISE <strong>I am learning about new things everyday.</strong> It's a new experience integrating new technologies.

I took some online courses and watched some YouTube playlists but at some point or another, <strong>I would always get stuck even if I followed the instructions.

If I have a big problem, I can swing by the office where <strong>the TECHRISE team is happy to help me out.</strong> Moreover, the TECHRISE curriculum also includes <strong>building real world apps like Instagram</strong> which fired up my eagerness to learn more.

                      I was not so good at coding and was unknown what to do so I can move with the flow of current world but after joining TECHRISE, I am good at coding and able to choose the right field to set my career. Thank you TECHRISE for providing guidance to build up my skill and confidence through lessons, weekly mentor section and assignments.

                      TECHRISE provides a platform on developing web-apps using Ruby on Rails. In my perspective, no one will regret by joining TECHRISE. Currently, I am working on Ideator, a web application where anyone can post their ideas. It feels confusing and frustrating when stuck that I want to stop coding. But no need to worry as there are our mentors who guide us and solve our problem. We receive almost instant replies to all of our questions whenever needed.

                      <strong>TECHRISE has been by far the best learning experience for me.</strong> My mentor, Takehiro, was very helpful during the course. He is very passionate when it comes to teaching, always willing to explain the concepts behind what we were doing. Having that understanding makes it possible to apply that knowledge in different places. <strong>These 3 months have been challenging but worth it.</strong>

                      <strong>I was lost and was trying many courses on the internet.</strong> After joining TECHRISE, I got courses of my preference and suitable to the current market. <strong>Weekly mentor sessions, well presented, tested and clearly explained lessons and assignments' reviews were the best part learning here.</strong> Asking a lot of questions to my mentor, and discussing with other members in Slack enhanced fast understanding. Thank you TECHRISE for helping me build skills to make great apps.

                  Its my great pleasure to know that TECHRISE is launching a special skill development IT program specially for Nepali youth. <strong>It will definitely help to develop skilled manpower and provide a great employment opportunity abroad.</strong> Since the education system of Nepal is being a theoretical base, even after graduation in concern faculty, could not fit for the international labour markets. As per present scenario, <strong>more than 6,000,000 Nepalese unskilled workers are working abroad as a labourer</strong>. If we could able to train them as skilled manpower, <strong>it will definitely help Nepal's national economy</strong>. I, therefore wish all the success of TECHRISE and would like to extend my sincere thanks to co-founders of TECHRISE.

                  TECHRISE is more than a coding camp - it's <strong>a vehicle</strong> for empowering the youth of Nepal with the knowledge and tools they need to <strong>unlock their true economic and personal potential.</strong> Because the TECHRISE model provides former students to also become teachers, the organization is creating a <strong>network effect for sustainable and long-term transformative change</strong>. One student at a time, <strong>TECHRISE is not only changing lives at an individual level, but is also building a highly skilled workforce that has the potential to grow Nepal's economic stability as a whole.</strong>
