                Learning to code isn’t hard - if you have the right support. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Many resources are great at teaching coding, but some are aimed at being general, teaching you basic syntax and how the language works. Which is awesome, but it doesn’t teach you how to actually start building web apps.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are also resources that go super into detail and feed you a lot of information. These are awesome, but it probably isn't ideal for complete beginners.

                At Techrise, our goal is to give you fun and interactive lessons where you’ll learn how to build real world web applications with a devoted mentor so that you'll be able to start learning more advanced things on your own.
              </p>
              <p>
                Imagine building your ideas, building your friend’s business idea, or just building a cool app to solve one of your daily problems. All that is possible by learning how to code.
              </p>
              <p>
                The path to learning code can be rough. You’ll most likely be lost or quit unless you have a path that you can follow, and have a supportive community or mentors to guide you through the process.
              </p>
              <p>
                By learning to code with us, we provide that support so that you can start building your ideas.
