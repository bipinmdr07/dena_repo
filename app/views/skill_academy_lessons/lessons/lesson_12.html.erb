  How can we start building this feature?

    When building out features, <strong>it is important to focus on building the core functionality of the feature first, then working on the surrounding features later.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    In other words, don't try to build out every single aspect of the feature - just focus on building the most important elements of the feature.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this case, the most important thing is that users can sign in and sign out, and they have a link to do so in the navigation bar. We don't need to add any text or marketing material yet - we can do that later on in the development process.
