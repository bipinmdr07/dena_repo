<h1><%= title_for(SkillAcademyLesson, 6, 1) %></h1>

<p>
  Now that we've set up the courses, let's start building features so instructors can add sections to the courses.
</p>  

<%= render layout: 'shared/story', locals: {story_title: title_for(SkillAcademyLesson, 5, 3)} do %>
  <p>
    A course should have many sections. For example, an HTML/CSS course should have one section about what HTML and CSS is, one section about HTML tags, one section about p tags, etc. Let's build a feature so that instructors can easily add sections to the lessons.
  </p>

  <p>
    The instructor should be able to create a section from the instructor course show page. There should be a link that takes the instructor to a page to fill out information about the section.
  </p>  

  <ul>
    <li>User clicks on link to create section</li>
    <li>User fills out form</li>
    <li>A section should store the following information in the database:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><code>title</code></li>
      <li><code>course_id</code></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Once the user submits the form</li>
    <ul>
      <li>If the information is valid, then create a new section and redirect the user to the instructor course show page</li>
      <li>If the information is invalid, render the form again with a flash message</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
<% end %>
