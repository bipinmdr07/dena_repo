  Now that you've taken the red pill, there's no going back. <strong>Welcome to the world coding.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  For your first intro to HTML and CSS, we are going to use Dash Assembly's HTML and CSS course because it's simply <i>awesome</i>.
</p>

<p>
	Jump on to <a href = "https://dash.generalassemb.ly" target = "_blank">this link</a> to get started! You'll need to sign up for an account, but after that you'll be all set.
</p>

<p>
	You'll be building <strong>a personal website</strong>, a <strong>responsive blog theme</strong>, a <strong>small business website</strong>, and a <strong>CSS robot</strong>. Pretty awesome stuff! For an intro course, we think it's one of the best courses out there.

  <h3>What are Responsive Websites?</h3>
  <p>
  	A <strong><i>responsive</i> website</strong> is a website that responds to the screen size of the user. Because many people now use their smartphones to surf the internet, it makes sense to make the website look nice on both computers and smartphones.
  </p> 
  <p>
    For example, this website is responsive. Try shrinking the browser and you will see the components shrinking and expanding like magic.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the Dash course you'll do in this section, you'll learn how to make responsive websites. Throughout your time at Techrise, you'll learn how to make responsive websites. <strong>Having the mindset of creating websites that are responsive is important in web development.</strong>

  For now, let's not worry about completing Project 5 since it goes into JavaScript. Let's focus on trying to finish Project 1 ~ 4. If you're really ambitious, you can go ahead and finish Project 5, but it's not necessary to do just yet. We'll get there soon though!
</p>

<p>
  Once you've completed the course, <span style="color:red;">upload a screenshot of your completed Dash Assembly screen using <a href = "http://imgur.com/" target = "_blank">imgur</a> and post the link in below in the submissions section</span> so that we can see that you've completed the course. We'll take a look at your work and give you a thumbs up. While you wait for feedback, feel free to go ahead to the next lesson and learn some more HTML and CSS.
