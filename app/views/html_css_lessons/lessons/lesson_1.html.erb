	Here's when the fun begins! You'll finally write your first lines of code delve into the world of coding.
</p>

<p>
  The first skill you will acquire is writing HTML and CSS code.
</p>

<blockquote>

	<p>Just a quick refresher:</p>

	<footer>
		HTML is a language that describes the structure of the web page. Every web page has an HTML file and it's what dictates what you see on the browser. With HTML, you can tell the web page to have a header with the name "I like Ice Cream", a paragraph saying "Ice cream is a sophisticated food. It comes in all flavors and colors, etc...", an image of ice cream on top of the paragraph, etc. You can basically tell the web page what you want to include in what format.
	</footer>
	<br>
	<footer>
		CSS is a language that describes how the web page should be displayed. So basically with CSS, you can make the web page have a super pink background, make the fonts huge, or anything you want it to look like. Think of CSS like a blueprint for your design.

<p>
  HTML and CSS is pretty simple once you get used to it. Don't worry about memorizing all the syntax, that will come with time and experience. If you forget the syntax, you can always just Google it ;)
</p>

<p>
  What you should be focusing on though, is understand the general flow of how a web page is structured. If you stumble across a question like "wait, how do I make a link to a URL again?", <strong>Google it.</strong> Google "how to make a link to url html" and you'll get your answer in 2 seconds. What do you do if you want to make the color of your font red? Google "how to make font color red". Boom, you got your answer. Easy, right?
