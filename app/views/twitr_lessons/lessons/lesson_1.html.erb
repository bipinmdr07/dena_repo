	Get ready to embark on a new journey in your web development career! From this lesson, we'll be creating rails applications together, where you'll learn how to create full featured applications.

	<h3>How to gain the most out of the lessons</h3>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Don't copy and paste</strong> - it is always better to actually type the code yourself. <strong>Muscle memory</strong> is really important when learning how to code!</li>
		<li><strong>Ask Questions</strong> - whenever something doesn't make sense to you, first google, then ask for help! We are always here to help out.</li>
		<li><strong>Don't be frustrated</strong> - some of these lessons might be difficult for you, but don't be frustrated, it's part of learning and it is important to relax and keep on going.</li>
	</ul>

<p>
	Let's get started!

<div class="well">
	<h3>What we will be building</h3>

	<p>
		Go to <%= link_to 'this link', 'https://techrise-twitr.herokuapp.com/' %> to get an overview of what kind of application we are going to create.
	</p>	

	<p>
		It is a simple web application where users can post tweets free onto the website. Think of it as a super simple version of Twitter.

<h2>Setting Up Your Cloud9 Environment</h2>

<p>
	Installing Ruby on Rails, Ruby, git, and everything else takes so much time and it can be extremely frustrating. We don't want you to get stuck on this part - we'd rather have you start coding immediately :) That's why we provide Cloud9 accounts for all of our students, so that any student can start coding right away.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
	You should have gotten an invitation from the TECHRISE team by now, but if you haven't please contact us at contact@techrise.me.
</p>

<p>
	Once you've signed up for Cloud9, then you can create a workspace:
</p>

<%= image_tag 'twitr/c9_dashboard.png', class: 'img-responsive screenshot' %>	

<p>
	Click on "Create New Workspace". This will take you to a new page where you can fill out information about your new project.
</p>

<p>
	Enter "Twitr" as the project name, and choose the Ruby template as shown below:
</p>

<%= image_tag 'twitr/c9_new_project.png', class: 'img-responsive screenshot' %>

<p>
	Finally, click the "Create Workspace" button. Just like that, your Rails environment has been created!
</p>

<p>		
	With C9, you can develop applications in the browser. The interface looks similar to a setup you would have on your computer.
</p>

<%= image_tag 'twitr/c9_interface.png', class: 'img-responsive screenshot' %>

<p>
	To create a new terminal window, you can click on the plus button up top:
</p>

<%= image_tag 'twitr/c9_new_terminal.png', class: 'img-responsive screenshot' %>

<p>	
	Try clicking around to see how everything works. Everything is designed so that it works just like the set up that you are used to!
</p>

<p>
	First, let's open up our terminal.
</p>


<div class="well">
	<h3>How to create a new Rails application</h3>

	<p>
		<strong>When using C9, you don't have to create a new Rails application - C9 does that all for you.</strong> But if you want to install Ruby on Rails and Ruby on your system and create a new Rails application, this is what you should do.
	</p>

	<p>
		The command to create a new Rails application is this:
	</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
rails new app_name
</code></pre>

	<p>
		You can replace <code>app_name</code> with any name that you want to give your app. Running this command will automatically generate many files for you so that you can get started on building your application instantly.
	</p>

	<%= create_flashcard %>

	<p>
		Running the command should create a bunch of files and you shouldn’t get any errors.
	</p>


</div>

<p>
	For every new Rails application, we have to create our initial database. In the terminal enter the following commands:
</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
rake db:create
</code></pre>


<div class="well">
	<h3>Databases</h3>

	<p>
		<strong>Databases are like a box that contains a bunch of information.</strong> In the database, we can <strong>store <em>various different types</em> of data</strong> and we can also <strong>pull out data</strong> from the database.
	</p>

	<P>
		In Rails, we create different databases for different purposes:
	</P>


	<table class="table" style="background:white">
		<tr>
			<th>Environment</th>
			<th>Purpose</th>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>development</td>
			<td>We use the development environment to develop our applications.</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>production</td>
			<td>This is the environment that will be used when released to the public.</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>test</td>
			<td>This is the environment that you will be using when testing the functionality of your application.</td>
		</tr>

	</table>

	<p>
		<strong>This means that data that is stored in the database in your development environment won't be shown in the production environment.</strong> Every database will hold different sets of data:
	</p>

	<%= image_tag 'twitr/database_environments.png', class: 'screenshot' %>
</div>

<div class="well">
	<h3>rake db:create</h3>

	<p>
		We run the <code>rake db:create</code> command to create a new database. This command creates a new database according to the information in the <code>database.yml</code> file.
	</p>

	<h3>database.yml</h3>

	<p>
		This file contains the database settings. Rails applications has different databases for each environment, so there are different configurations for each environment.
	</p>

	<%= image_tag 'twitr/database_yml.png', class: 'screenshot' %>
</div>


<p>
	Now let’s fire up our rails server by entering this command in the terminal window.
</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
rails s -b $IP -p $PORT
</code></pre>

<p>
	Give it a few seconds to load. You can start the application by clicking the Preview button:
</p>

<%= image_tag 'twitr/c9_start_server.png', class: 'screenshot' %>

<p>
	You should see a nice welcome page from Ruby on Rails.
</p>

<%= image_tag 'twitr/welcome_page.png', class: 'img-responsive screenshot', style: 'margin-bottom: 30px' %>

<p>
  Awesome! You're one step closer to finishing your first rails app!
</p>
